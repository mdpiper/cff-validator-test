# run-cff-validator

Add a citation file to this repository
and run the [cff-validator](https://github.com/dieghernan/cff-validator) GitHub Action.

I found the [CFF schema guide](https://github.com/citation-file-format/citation-file-format/blob/main/schema-guide.md)
very helpful for debugging an invalid CFF file.
